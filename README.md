 
 # CarbonCuisine ‚Äì Where Food Meets Emissions Analytics

CarbonCuisine is a data exploration and analytics project focused on uncovering the relationship between food choices and their environmental impact.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between different food categories and their carbon emissions using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Identify key factors contributing to high or low emission levels across production, region, and diet type.
- Provide insights that promote sustainable food choices and data-driven environmental policies.

(Under Process)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks/DATA_EDA.ipynb
Or, if using VS Code:
code notebooks/DATA_EDA.ipynb

## üìä Key Insights

After running the EDA, you can summarize findings such as:
Plant-based foods show significantly lower CO‚ÇÇ emissions than meat products.
Dairy and beef production have the highest carbon intensity per calorie.
Regional dietary trends impact the overall sustainability index.
Potential areas for emission reduction exist in supply chain optimization.


Develop a prediction model for estimating emissions based on food composition.
Build a dashboard to visualize food-emission relationships interactively.
Integrate with APIs providing real-time food sustainability data.
